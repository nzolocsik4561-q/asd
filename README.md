# asd activity automation

This repository bundles helper scripts for generating GitHub activity.

- `backfill_commits.py`: emit dated commits by appending to `keep.log`.
- `auto_activity.py`: minimal PR/Issue automation using GitHub CLI.
- `activity_automation.py`: orchestrates large batches of commits, PRs, and issues.

Run `python3 activity_automation.py --help` to explore options.
